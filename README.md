Project Documentation 
Project Title: Digital Literacy Data Analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn 
1.	Project Overview 
This project analyzes digital literacy levels across different population groups using Python. The dataset was cleaned and explored to identify how factors such as income, employment status, education, and basic computer skills impact digital access. Data visualizations were created to highlight key patterns and digital gaps, demonstrating practical data analysis and visualization skills. 
2.	Tools Used 
•	Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation 
•	Matplotlib – Basic data visualization 
•	Seaborn – Advanced and statistical visualizations 
3.	Dataset 
•	Source: Sample Digital Literacy Dataset
•	Description: The dataset contains structured information related to digital  literacy levels among different population groups. Key columns include:
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Education Level
•	Income Level
•	Employment Status
•	Basic Computer Skills
•	Internet Access
•	Digital Literacy Level

4.	Steps Followed 
1.	Imported the dataset using Pandas. 
2.	Cleaned the data by: 
o	Removing missing and duplicate values 
o	Converting date and numeric columns to proper formats 
3.	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas. 
4.	Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
5.	Interpreted the results to extract meaningful insights. 
 
5.	Key Insights 
•	Digital literacy levels are significantly lower among low-income users compared to higher-income groups.
•	Employment status and education level show a strong impact on basic computer and internet skills.
•	A noticeable gap exists between high-skill unemployed individuals and digitally active employed users.

6.	Visualizations 
•	Bar chart showing average skill scores before and after training
•	Histogram showing overall literacy scores in the dataset
•	Heatmap displaying correlation between numerical variables in the dataset
7.	Files Included 
•	Digital_literacy_dataset.csv – Raw dataset 
•	Digital literacy analysis.ipynb – Pandas analysis and visualizations 
•	README.md – Project description and usage instructions 
8.	How to Use 
1.	Open Main project.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. 
2.	Run the notebook cells step by step to view data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations. 
3.	Modify the code to explore additional insights if needed. 
9.	Conclusion 
This project demonstrates how data analytics can be used to assess digital literacy levels across different population groups. By applying data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques in Python, key digital gaps were identified based on income, education, and employment status. The insights from this analysis highlight the importance of targeted digital inclusion efforts and showcase practical dat
